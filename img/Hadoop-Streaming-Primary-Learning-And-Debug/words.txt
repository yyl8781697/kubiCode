In recent years, Micro-blog has been more and more popular. Precisely, Micro-blog has become part of people's life. It seems that everybody has a Micro-blog now. Many factors contribute to the widespread of Micro-blogging.
First, Micro-blog enables people to convey their emotions and individual thoughts more conveniently. Micro-blog has no fixed rules and needn't professional knowledge and skills, which enables millions of people to have a voice and connect with others. Moreover, people can express their instant feelings at any time and anywhere if they have a phone.
Second, Micro-blog can communicate with each other more deeply. By revealing their heartfelt emotions on the Micro-blog, their friends may also know about their conditions and can offer in-time comfort. Third, Micro-blog really provides a platform for ordinary people to display their abilities, and it is a good form for people to share views and to get information.
However, Micro-blogging can also be potentially dangerous as it may give away people's privacy and other significant information. It might be used by some people who have ulterior motives to spread rumors or to slander other people.
In other hands, being susceptible to othersâ€˜ idea easily,most people tend to lose the ability of thinking independently.
In my opinion, Micro-blogging provides us comfort and also inevitably some concerns. We should be careful while using it.
